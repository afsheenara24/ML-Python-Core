# ML-Python-Core - Day 1

This repository contains my Day 1 work for building strong Machine Learning foundations using Python.

## Day 1 – Python for Machine Learning

Topics covered:
- Python basics for ML (functions, list comprehension, lambda)
- NumPy fundamentals (ndarray, vectorization, broadcasting)
- Performance comparison: loops vs vectorized operations
- Pandas basics (DataFrame, data inspection, cleaning)
- Simple feature engineering

## Files

- day01_numpy_basics.ipynb  
  Covers NumPy arrays, vectorized operations, broadcasting, and matrix math.

- day01_pandas_basics.ipynb  
  Covers data loading, inspection, handling missing values, and feature creation.

## Tools Used

- Python 3.10
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Jupyter Notebook
- Conda environment

## How to Run

1. Activate conda environment
2. Open Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab
3. Run the notebooks cell by cell

## Goal

To build strong fundamentals in Python and data handling as a foundation for Machine Learning and AI projects.
